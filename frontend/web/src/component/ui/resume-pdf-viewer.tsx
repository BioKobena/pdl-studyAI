              AdobeÂ® Portable Document Format (PDF) is a universal file format that preserves all
              of the fonts, formatting, colours and graphics of any source document, regardless of
              the application and platform used to create it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Adobe PDF is an ideal format for electronic document distribution as it overcomes the
              problems commonly encountered with electronic file sharing.
